## How To Contribute

### Report a Bug or Request a Feature

If you encounter any bugs while using this software, or want to request a new feature or enhancement, feel free to [create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) to report it, make sure you add a label to indicate what type of issue it is.

### Contribute Code
Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes. If you want to implement something new, please [request a feature first](#report-a-bug-or-request-a-feature) so we can discuss it.

#### Creating a Pull Request
Before you submit any code, we need you to agree to our [Contributor License Agreement](https://yahoocla.herokuapp.com/); this ensures we can continue to protect your contributions under an open source license well into the future.

Please follow [best practices](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices) for creating git commits.

We also ask you to use the following guidelines:
  1.  Make sure your code respects existing formatting conventions. In general, follow the same coding style as the code that you are modifying.
  2.  Do add/update documentation appropriately for the change you are making.
  3.  Bugfixes should include a unit test or integration test reproducing the issue.
  4.  Do not use author tags/information in the code.
  5.  Always include license header on each file your create.
  6.  Try to keep pull requests short and submit separate ones for unrelated features, but feel free to combine simple bugfixes/tests into one pull request.
  7.  Keep the number of commits small and combine commits for related changes. Each commit should compile on its own and ideally pass tests.
  8.  Keep formatting changes in separate commits to make code reviews easier and distinguish them from actual code changes.

When your code is ready to be submitted, you can [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to begin the code review process.
